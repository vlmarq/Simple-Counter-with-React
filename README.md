# Simple Counter with React

React improves the creation of custom components, which you can render throughout your web-app using the **ReactDOM.render()** method. A custom component allows you to divide and conquer, separating logical and visual challenges into smaller pieces- giving you greater control over the display and functionalities of each part of the web-app.

For example, to create a bootstrap `<Card />`; component you'd code this:

```jsx
function Card(props){
    return (
        <div className="card">
            <img className="card-img-top" src="http://via.placeholder.com/350x150" alt="Card image cap" />
            <div className="card-body">
                <h5 className="card-title">Card title</h5>
                <p className="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and fill the card's content.</p>
                <a href="#" className="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

After declaring it, you are able to **import** and **use** it in your webapp like this:

```jsx
//import react into the bundle
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Card from './component/Card.jsx'

ReactDOM.render(<Card />, document.querySelector('#root'));
```

Additionally, you can pass information through the Card component using **props**:

```html

<!-- Use of the custom component -->
<Card imageUrl="http://via.placeholder.com/350x150" title="A nice image" />

```

... for usage within the render method of your Card component (notice the image src and card title):

```jsx
//Declaration of custom component (Card.js)

function Card(props){
    return (
        <div className="card">
            <img className="card-img-top" src={props.imageUrl} alt="Card image cap" />
            <div className="card-body">
                <h5 className="card-title">{props.title}</h5>
                <p className="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and fill the card's content.</p>
                <a href="#" className="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

# üìù Instructions

Create a seconds-counter component, called ***SecondsCounter***. It should look [like this one](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-simple-counter-react/blob/master/preview.gif).

- The whole purpose of the component is to display how many seconds have passed since the website finished loading (onLoad).
- Use the ***ReactDOM.render()*** to render the component into the web-app.
- Use the ***setInterval()*** function to re-render de component on every second.
- The component does not need a local state, you can pass the number of seconds as **props** like this:

```
<SecondsCounter seconds={3434} />

```
- You can find the clock icon on the left of the component in [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

# üî• Bonus
- Create an option to countdown from a given number.
- Create stop, reset, and resume functionality
- Create an alert when the user reaches a specified time, ie the user enters "10", an alert should render notifying the user that their time was reached
